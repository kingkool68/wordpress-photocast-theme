## Photocast Theme

This was the first WordPress theme I ever made. It's a copy of the famous [Kubrick default WordPress theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/default/) that I tweaked to match my website. In 2007 I took a weekend to figure out how WordPress worked and eventually started my blog. See https://russellheimlich.com/blog/the-first-one/
